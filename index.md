## Experience

### *Alibaba DAMO, Research Experiences for Machine Translation** `2017.5 - 2017.8`

_Research Assistant_<br>
**Penrose** is a system that automatically visualizes mathematics using two domain-specific languages: **Substance** and **Style**. Co-advised by [Jonathan Aldrich](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./aldrich/), [Keenan Crane](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/), [Joshua Sunshine](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jssunshi/), and [Katherine Ye](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kqy/), I designed and implemented the Style language, and extended the Substance language to support functions and logically quantified statements.


## Honors & Awards
